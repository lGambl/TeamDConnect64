### Game Play
As the player you can tab through each cell and set the value on each but not on the ones that already set.
There is a timer that is constantly going down while the player plays but they can pause the game. When paused, you can't modify the board or see the board until you unpause. When the player feels like they have solved the board they can check it. If the board is solved it gives the player the option to go to the next puzzle or the main menu. If not then it says its not solved. If the player chooses to quit it will save the game
